# Audit Tests

Audit test code for tests that **pass for the wrong reason**. Goal: find
tests that look like coverage but would not catch a real regression.

## Scope

Determine what to audit based on `$ARGUMENTS`:

| Argument | Scope |
|----------|-------|
| *(empty)* | Tests in unstaged + staged changes (`git diff HEAD`) |
| `staged` | Tests in staged changes only |
| `branch` | Tests in all branch commits vs `main` |
| *file path* | Specific test file (`test/corpus/*.txt`, `test/highlight/*.tcl`) |
| *directory path* | All test files under the directory |

---

## Step 1: Collect test code

1. For diff-based scopes: extract only the corpus/highlight tests added or
   modified. Pre-existing unchanged tests are out of scope.
2. For path scopes: include all corpus tests under `test/corpus/` and
   highlight tests under `test/highlight/`.
3. Read each test file in full — surrounding tests and shared fixtures matter.

---

## Step 2: Understand what each test claims to verify

For every test in scope, answer three questions:

1. **What does the test name say?** Parse the heading as a specification.
2. **What does the body actually verify?** For corpus tests, read both the
   input source and the expected AST. For highlight tests, read the input and
   the inline `; ^^^^ @capture` markers.
3. **What would have to break for this test to fail?** That is the test's
   real coverage claim.

If 1 and 3 disagree, that is a finding.

---

## Step 3: Audit checklist

```
FINDING: <short title>
FILE: <path>:<line range>
EVIDENCE: <what is wrong and why>
SEVERITY: false-pass | weak-assertion | wrong-target | incidental
EFFORT: trivial | small | medium
```

### Corpus tests (`test/corpus/`)

1. **Empty / wildcard expected tree**: does the expected `(source_file)` have
   no children, or only opaque parents? A test that asserts "parses to *some*
   source_file" catches almost nothing.
2. **Trivial input**: does the input not actually exercise the rule the test
   name implies? A test named `Event handler with priority modifier` whose
   input is `when X { }` (no priority) is false-pass.
3. **No field names where the rule defines them**: `when_event` defines
   `field('event', ...)` and `field('body', ...)`. If the expected tree
   omits the field labels, a regression that drops the field wiring still
   passes.
4. **Wrong rule asserted**: does the expected tree show the input parsing as a
   generic `(command)` when the new rule (`when_event`) was supposed to
   handle it? That is a wrong-target test masquerading as coverage of the
   new rule.
5. **Coupling to incidental whitespace / formatting**: corpus tests should
   not be sensitive to comment placement or trailing newlines unless the
   grammar specifically pins those.
6. **Single-event test for a multi-event rule**: a `when_event` rule should
   be tested with sequential `when` blocks, modifiers, and no body, not just
   one canonical example.

### Highlight tests (`test/highlight/`)

7. **Capture marker on the wrong span**: `; ^^^^^ @keyword` aligned to fewer
   characters than the keyword spans is a silent partial check.
8. **Missing negative coverage**: if the grammar conditionally tags
   `HTTP::host` as `@function.builtin`, the highlight tests must include a
   non-namespaced command (`set foo bar`) to confirm the regex did not
   over-match.

### Tests that test the framework

9. Does a new test reduce to "tree-sitter parses anything" rather than the
   specific construct? `(source_file)` with no children is a smoke test, not
   a regression test.

---

## Step 4: Verify findings by execution

For every finding, run:

```bash
npx tree-sitter test --include "<test-name regex>"
```

Confirm the test currently passes. For false-pass findings, the strongest
verification is mutation: temporarily perturb `grammar.js` (e.g. delete the
`when_event` rule), regenerate (`npx tree-sitter generate`), and re-run the
test. If the test still passes, the false-pass is confirmed. **Revert the
grammar change after.**

This step is mandatory. Do not report findings based solely on reading.

---

## Step 5: Report and fix

```
## Test Audit: <scope>

### False-pass
| # | Finding | File:Line | Effort | Evidence |

### Weak assertions
| # | Finding | File:Line | Effort | Evidence |

### Wrong target
| # | Finding | File:Line | Effort | Evidence |

### Summary
- Tests audited: N
- Findings: N
- Verdict: PASS | FINDINGS TO FIX
```

For each finding, fix the test directly:

- **False-pass**: redesign the input so the rule under test is actually
  exercised.
- **Weak assertion**: add the missing field labels or child nodes to the
  expected tree.
- **Wrong target**: rename or rewrite to match the name.

After fixing, re-run `npx tree-sitter test` to verify everything still passes.

---

## Guardrails

- Do NOT report findings without verifying by execution.
- Do NOT touch grammar / queries / bindings — only test files.
- Never rewrite an entire corpus file to fix one test; modify only what
  needs changing.
- Run `npx tree-sitter test` after fixes to confirm nothing else broke.
